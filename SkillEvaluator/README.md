SkillEvaluator is an open-source, multi-tier framework for evaluating AI agent
artifacts, starting with agent skills: deterministic quality gates, semantic
overlap detection, synthetic eval dataset generation, and live agent evaluation.

Agent skills are folders of instructions and supporting files that extend AI
agents, as defined by the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/).
SkillEvaluator is part of the
[NVIDIA Verified Skills pipeline](https://github.com/NVIDIA/skills).

## Three-tier overview

![SkillEvaluator three-tier pipeline: Skill → Tier 1 Validation → Tier 2 Deduplication → Tier 3 Live Evaluation → Reports](docs/assets/three-tier-overview.svg)

Tiers are independent entry points; nothing requires running earlier ones first.

| Tier | Purpose | Representative commands | Requires |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tier 1: Validation | Safe & well-formed? | `validate`, `quality-check`, `security-scan`, `pii-scan`, `lint-scripts`, `rubric-eval` | No API key for deterministic checks; the `security` extra plus external Semgrep, SkillSpector, and Gitleaks for full scanner coverage; a provider key for LLM checks |
| Tier 2: Deduplication | Overlap with what exists? | `context-optimization-check`, `similarity-check` | An embeddings provider; intra-skill analysis also needs a chat LLM — local OpenAI-compatible endpoints work |
| Tier 3: Live Evaluation | Does it help the agent? | `create-eval-dataset`, `tier3 evaluate`, `compare` | No credential for keyless templates and report inspection; a provider key for LLM generation and grading; live evaluation also needs the agent CLI with its credential and a Docker, local OS, or cloud sandbox |

[SkillSpector](https://github.com/NVIDIA/SkillSpector) provides specialized
security scanning for Tier 1 validation.
[Harbor](https://github.com/harbor-framework/harbor), the open-source agent
evaluation framework, powers the sandboxed agent runs in Tier 3 live
evaluation. Full tier guides live in the
[documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/skills/skillevaluator/).

## Quickstart

Install all SkillEvaluator evaluation extras with
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), then run the built-in deterministic validation
gates. This first result needs no API key, Docker daemon, or repository clone:

```bash
uv tool install --python 3.13 "skillevaluator[all] @ git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/SkillEvaluator.git"
skillevaluator validate ./my-skill \
  --checks schema,pii,license,quality,unicode,lint \
  --no-dedup
```

`./my-skill` is any directory containing a `SKILL.md`. The command checks its
schema, PII, license, quality, Unicode safety, and scripts. The scoped check
list keeps this first run keyless; the complete Tier 1 security scan also uses
external tools described in the
[installation guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/skills/skillevaluator/installation).
If your shell cannot find the command after installation, run
`uv tool update-shell` and open a new terminal.

## LLM provider setup

No OpenAI or Anthropic key yet? Create a free API key at
[build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com) — NVIDIA Build offers free
inferencing, and NVIDIA Build defaults to the open-source Nemotron model
`nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b` for a quick try. Prefer a different model?
Pick any free model on [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com) and set
`SKILL_EVAL_LLM_MODEL`. Once that key is set, the same provider works
seamlessly across Tier 1 LLM checks, Tier 2, and Tier 3 (chat plus embeddings
with one credential):

```bash
export SKILL_EVAL_LLM_PROVIDER=nv_build
export NVIDIA_API_KEY='nvapi-...'
skillevaluator models --limit 10
```

Other supported provider setups are:

- OpenAI: `SKILL_EVAL_LLM_PROVIDER=openai` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- Anthropic: `SKILL_EVAL_LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- Amazon Bedrock: `SKILL_EVAL_LLM_PROVIDER=bedrock` plus the standard AWS
  credential chain and region.
- Local or hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoint: set
  `SKILL_EVAL_LLM_PROVIDER=openai-compatible`,
  `SKILL_EVAL_LLM_BASE_URL`, `SKILL_EVAL_LLM_MODEL`, and
  `SKILL_EVAL_LLM_API_KEY`.

When exactly one of `NVIDIA_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
is present, SkillEvaluator can auto-select that provider. Anthropic and Bedrock
do not provide embeddings, so Tier 2 also needs a separate OpenAI, NVIDIA
Build, or OpenAI-compatible embedding provider. See
[Providers & Credentials](https://docs.nvidia.com/skills/skillevaluator/configuration)
for model defaults, endpoint overrides, and fully local setup.

## Run deeper evaluations

`similarity-check` needs an embeddings provider. `context-optimization-check`
also needs a chat provider to check one skill for repeated guidance:

```bash
skillevaluator context-optimization-check ./my-skill
skillevaluator similarity-check ./skills
```

Install Semgrep, SkillSpector, and Gitleaks before a full run; missing Tier 1
scanner evidence makes validation incomplete. Then verify the selected agent
runtime and use `validate --full`:

```bash
skillevaluator doctor --agents codex --env-mode docker
skillevaluator validate ./my-skill \
  --full \
  --agents codex \
  --env-mode docker
```

`--full` runs Tiers 1, 2, and 3 and enables autopilot. If the skill has no
accepted evaluation source, autopilot creates one initial case at
`evals/evals.json`; if the file already exists, SkillEvaluator reuses it. For a
broader four-bucket dataset, generate and review it first:

```bash
skillevaluator create-eval-dataset ./my-skill --full
```

Tier 2 needs chat and embedding providers. Tier 3 also needs the evaluator
provider, the selected agent's credential, and a Docker, local, or cloud
sandbox. Live model calls and managed sandboxes can incur charges; local mode
avoids managed sandbox charges, not hosted model charges. It is experimental
and only for trusted skills and workspaces; use Docker or cloud for untrusted
code. Start with one agent and a small dataset.
See the [Tier 3 guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/skills/skillevaluator/tier3-live-evaluation#plan-for-cost)
before scaling a run. Tier 3 results are advisory within `validate`; Tier 1 and
Tier 2 determine its exit status.
