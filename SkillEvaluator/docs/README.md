# Documentation

Long-form documentation for SkillEvaluator. Pages are authored in MDX and
published to <https://docs.nvidia.com/skills/skillevaluator>. This page is the human
quickstart; [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) holds the detailed authoring rules (MDX
gotchas, link conventions, page-adding checklist) for both AI agents and
contributors making non-trivial edits.

## Layout

- `index.mdx` — landing page and three-tier overview
- `installation.mdx` — extras, pip, Docker, requirements
- `configuration.mdx` — credential map, providers, and embeddings
- `tier1-validation.mdx` — checks, flags, reports, CI recipe
- `tier2-deduplication.mdx` — dedup commands and thresholds
- `tier3-live-evaluation.mdx` — skill evaluation with live agents
- `developer-guide.mdx` — contributor setup

Navigation order and slugs are defined in [`../fern/docs.yml`](../fern/docs.yml).

## Build Locally

You only need to build locally if you are editing the documentation. The site is
published automatically from `main` via the Fern GitHub integration.

Prerequisites: Node.js 22+ and npm 10+ (the versions the Fern CLI requires).

```bash
# Install the Fern CLI
npm install -g fern-api

# From the repo root, preview the site with live reload
fern docs dev

# Validate the docs configuration and links
fern check
```

`fern docs dev` serves the site at <http://localhost:3000> and reloads on changes
to `.mdx` files or `fern/docs.yml`.

## Authoring Notes

- New pages must be added to the `navigation` section of
  [`../fern/docs.yml`](../fern/docs.yml); otherwise they will not appear in the
  site.
- Use relative links between MDX pages (`./configuration.mdx`) and relative repo
  links (`../README.md`) for files outside `docs/`.
- The Fern version is pinned in
  [`../fern/fern.config.json`](../fern/fern.config.json); bump it intentionally
  rather than as a side effect.
