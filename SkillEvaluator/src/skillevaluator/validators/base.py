"""Base validator class and result model.

This module provides the foundation for all SkillEvaluator validators with:
- Finding: Structured validation finding with full context for CI reporting
- ValidationResult: Dataclass for collecting validation outcomes
- ValidatorBase: Abstract base class with folder-level validation support

Note: The Finding and ValidationResult classes are now defined in skillevaluator.models.result
and re-exported here for backward compatibility. New code should import from
skillevaluator.models directly.

    depth so that ``evals/results/.../foo.txt`` and a re-occurrence under
    ``references/evals/foo.md`` are both filtered out. Excluded directories
    are pruned during the walk (never descended into), and symlinked
    directories are not followed.
    Skips generated publishing artifacts listed in ``excluded_files`` (defaults
    to :data:`SCAN_EXCLUDED_FILES`) by basename, case-insensitively.

        extensions: Iterable of file extensions including the leading dot
